   ** Warning ** Processing Monthly Tabular Reports: Variable names not valid for this simulation
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual variables.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-ELECTRICITY" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-DISTILLATE OIL" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-RESIDUAL OIL" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-NATURAL GAS" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-COAL" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ************* Simulation Error Summary *************
   ************* There are 6 unused schedules in input.
   ************* There are 6 unused week schedules in input.
   ************* There are 12 unused day schedules in input.

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
